        Let’s picture this: you’re a high school student in their junior year, and you’re about to become a senior. You’ve now been tasked with the question, what are you going to do for college? How will you pay for it? Is there another way to get to your goals? If so, what are they? 
          <br>
          <br>
          Obviously, none of these are easy questions. They won’t always have the same answer for everyone either. But there is one question that has a simple answer to it: why am I writing about this?

        Our page has one main goal: to help people understand the importance of   decision-making better. Decision-making is a complex process that we all have to deal with, but some of us have a more difficult time on a regular basis making the challenging choices that could affect our lives.
